# 🌊 ARCA – Flood Alert Platform 

Landing page created as part of the **Global Solution** project at my college **FIAP**.  
The challenge was to propose and prototype a **solution to the flooding problem in São Paulo**. 
As part of the **Front-End Design** and **Web Development** courses, I developed a fictional brand called **ARCA** and built its landing page to present the solution and engage the community.
